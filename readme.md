## Current status: GIVE UP
<span style="color:teal" > *This contains my codes, results, and website-HTML of the magnetohydrodynamics term paper about mean field galactic dynamos.*</span>
### About the project: 

The project is about the mean-field dynamo mechanism in a thin disc galaxy and is solved <span style="color:brown">1D in r</span>. All the theory materials for this are available in a folder called Student in Drive. 

### Task 1 AND 2:


- Task 1 solves the diffusion equation, but no alpha or omega terms exist.
- Task 2 incorporates the alpha-omega effect into Task 1.
  
### Task 3:

- alpha omega dynamo with <span style="color:brown">outflows</span>
- The entire work of task 3 is based upon a 2000 paper by David Moss.
